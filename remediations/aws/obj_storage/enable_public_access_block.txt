For S3 buckets, call the PutPublicAccessBlock API [1][2] , and set the following configuration parameters to `true`: 

"BlockPublicAcls"
"IgnorePublicAcls" 
"BlockPublicPolicy"
"RestrictPublicBuckets"       

NOTE: If you are managing resources with Infrastructure as Code software, please refer to your provider's documentation on how to safely remediate your resources to avoid configuration drift.

For more information on blocking access to your S3 buckets, please see the S3 Documentation page "Blocking public access to your Amazon S3 storage" [3].
