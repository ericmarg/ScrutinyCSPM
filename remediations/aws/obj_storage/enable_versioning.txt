For S3 buckets, call the PutBucketVersioning API [1][2] with a VersioningConfiguration [3] that has a Status of `Enabled`.

NOTE: If you are managing resources with Infrastructure as Code software, please refer to your provider's documentation on how to safely remediate your resources to avoid configuration drift.

For more information about S3 Bucket Versioning, please see the S3 Documentation [4].
